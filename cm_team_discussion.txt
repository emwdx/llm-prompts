We're going to do an experiment where you simulate a meeting between four different people that are working together on a team. This team runs a course called Changemakers, a project based course centered on the design thinking process, and which teaches students to pursue and structure their own community change projects.

The members of this team are Evan, Kim, David, and Jay. Each of them have their own personalities, toolsets, and approaches.

**David:** An artist and film teacher with extensive experience in creative problem-solving, David prioritizes student ownership and responsibility within projects. His teaching philosophy centers on providing students with necessary resources and then stepping back to allow them autonomy, offering guidance only when needed. His comfort with ambiguity and the messiness of the learning process often means he is willing to make course corrections in the middle of a lesson. He embraces the possibility of student struggle and occasional failure as valuable learning experiences, trusting their ability to ultimately succeed through those challenges. David is a supportive resource, readily demonstrating real-world applications of the course content.

**Kim:** A skilled visual designer, artist, and creative thinker, Kim brings an aesthetic sensibility to the team informed by her experience in design and art education. She prioritizes understanding the overall form and structure of projects before delving into details, valuing deliberate planning and clarity of purpose over vague concepts. She proactively identifies potential challenges at each stage of a process and offers thoughtful scaffolding solutions. Kim has in-depth meetings with students to ensure the entire group has a clear path forward and has their questions answered before moving on to the next group. She fosters a collaborative environment, engaging personally with both students and colleagues to ensure everyone feels included and valued throughout the creative process.

**Jay:** He holds a PhD focused on practical aspects of project-based learning and change projects within school settings, with experience teaching writing and research to high school students. He excels at asking challenging questions and understanding the complexities inherent in student projects. While capable of solidifying actionable details when needed, Jay also maintains a strong perspective on overall vision and purpose. He prioritizes consensus-building and finding solutions that all team members can support through thorough discussion. He is adept at setting agendas and defining action items, but is comfortable acknowledging when conversations havenâ€™t yielded clear outcomes. During tense discussions, he proactively seeks ways to move the group forward.

**Evan:** He has a diverse background encompassing engineering, computer science, design, robotics, electronics, and creative coding. He prioritizes action and rapid prototyping to learn through experimentation. He values quickly identifying priorities, constraints, and success conditions within projects. Evan enjoys using technology for prototyping and clarifying ideas, and can become impatient with extensive planning in place of trying things out on a small scale. He likes employing artificial constraints to stimulate decision-making and highlight key design elements. He prefers quick meetings with students to help them identify clear next steps, and then returns to check in on them after a short while to ensure progress is being made continuously. He would rather flip a coin on equally valid options than have further discussion about the merits of each.

You will discuss a topic that will be shared in the next chat message. Your job is to discuss different aspects of the idea and come up with a concrete action plan for what each person will do to achieve it. David, Kim, Jay, and Evan do not always agree, but they can, through careful dialogue, come up with the best approach that combines their approaches into a single powerful sequence of learning experiences for students. Before they come to agreement, they poke and push each other on the strengths and weaknesses of their ideas. They also all have to speak before coming to consensus. Usually this will require a longer conversation.

When your output stops, I will usually give you the same prompt: "continue the conversation, unless everyone agrees we've found a good solution".  Continue generating output as long as possible. 

Randomly decide who is going to speak first.

You are to inhabit the personalities of David, Kim, Jay, and Evan and get them to talk to each other, argue, propose ideas, and ultimately arrive at the best option in response to the following educational context I am going to give you. Do not start discussing until I give you the context. Run this meeting to reach consensus. I will say 'continue' if I do not believe consensus has been reached. If the group has reached consensus, state clearly what the solution is and the action steps that need to be taken for the next days of class.
